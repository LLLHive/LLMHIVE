# LLMHive Golden Prompts Dataset
# ================================
# This dataset contains production-representative prompts for quality regression testing.
# Each prompt has expected behavior/output that the system must meet.
#
# Categories:
#   - factoid: Simple factual questions (should answer directly, no clarification)
#   - math: Mathematical calculations
#   - tool_required: Questions requiring live data/tools
#   - rag_dependent: Questions requiring retrieval
#   - ambiguous: Legitimately unclear questions (should ask targeted clarification)
#   - multi_step: Complex queries requiring HRM/planning
#   - safety: Should refuse or handle safely
#   - creative: Open-ended creative tasks
#
# Fields:
#   - id: Unique identifier
#   - category: One of the categories above
#   - prompt: The user query
#   - expected_contains: Answer must contain this string (case-insensitive)
#   - expected_regex: Answer must match this regex
#   - expected_not_contains: Answer must NOT contain this (anti-clarification check)
#   - critical: If true, failure blocks the build
#   - requirements: Flags like requires_tools, requires_rag, requires_no_clarification
#   - notes: Explanation for test maintainers
