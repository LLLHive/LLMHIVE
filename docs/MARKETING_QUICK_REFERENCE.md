## 📋 FAQ Responses

**Q: What benchmarks did you use?**
A: GSM8K (math) and MMLU (knowledge) - the same benchmarks used to evaluate GPT-5.2 Pro, Claude Opus 4.5, and Gemini 3 Pro.

**Q: Can I verify your results?**
A: Yes! Our evaluation scripts are available at `scripts/run_real_industry_benchmarks.py` and use public datasets from Hugging Face.

**Q: How does ELITE tier compare to FREE tier?**
A: ELITE tier uses premium models for maximum accuracy (82% GSM8K). FREE tier is optimized for cost with slightly lower accuracy. Final FREE tier benchmarks coming within 7 days.

**Q: What's your SLA?**
A: We achieved 99.3% reliability during production testing (5 errors in 700 queries). Formal SLA available for enterprise contracts.

**Q: Can you match GPT-5.2 Pro's 99% accuracy?**
A: Not at current pricing. We're optimized for the 80/20 rule: deliver 82% of the performance at 10% of the cost. For use cases requiring 99% accuracy, we recommend GPT-5.2 Pro or our upcoming premium tier.
