## First Comment (Maker Comment)

👋 Hey Product Hunt!

I'm [NAME], the founder of LLMHive. Super excited to share what we've been building!

**The Problem We Solved:**
Like many of you, I was constantly switching between ChatGPT, Claude, and other AI tools depending on the task. "Is this a Claude question or a GPT question?" It was exhausting.

**The Solution:**
LLMHive combines ALL major AI models through intelligent orchestration. Instead of picking one, our system automatically routes queries to the best model—or combines multiple models for superior results.

**What Makes Us Different:**
🐝 **Multi-Model Orchestration** - GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, and 400+ more
🏆 **#1 in All Categories** - Independently verified across 10 benchmark categories
⚡ **ELITE Mode** - HRM, DeepConf, and Adaptive Ensemble for maximum accuracy
💰 **Better Value** - One subscription instead of paying for multiple AI tools

**Quick Numbers:**
- Beats ChatGPT Pro by 5% on composite scores
- 400+ models available
- #1 ranking in General Reasoning, Coding, Math, Multilingual, and more

**Try It Free:**
Sign up at llmhive.ai and get 50 free ELITE queries—no credit card needed. Just see the difference for yourself.

Would love to hear your feedback! Happy to answer any questions. 🙏

## Suggested Replies to Common Questions

### "How is this different from OpenRouter?"
> Great question! OpenRouter is fantastic for model routing, but LLMHive goes further with intelligent orchestration. We don't just route to one model—we combine outputs from multiple models, run consensus voting, and use proprietary methods like HRM and DeepConf to synthesize the best possible answer. Think of it as the difference between a solo musician and an orchestra.

### "What models are included?"
> We support 400+ models through multiple providers: OpenAI (GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo), Anthropic (Claude 3 Opus, Sonnet, Haiku), Google (Gemini Pro, Ultra), DeepSeek, Mistral, Meta Llama, and many more. Our ELITE mode uses the top 5 models in consensus for maximum accuracy.

### "How does pricing compare to ChatGPT Pro?"
> ChatGPT Pro is $20/month for one model. Our Pro tier is $29.99/month and gives you access to ALL models plus our orchestration engine that consistently outperforms single-model solutions. The extra $10/month gets you significantly better results across all categories.

### "Is there an API?"
> Yes! Pro and higher tiers include full API access. We're OpenAI-compatible, so you can often swap your existing integrations with minimal changes.

### "What about data privacy?"
> Your data is never used to train models. We're SOC 2 compliant (Enterprise tier), GDPR/CCPA compliant, and offer PII redaction and content filtering. Enterprise customers get additional security features including SSO/SAML.

### "Can I use this for my team?"
> Absolutely! Our Enterprise tier ($35/seat/month, min 5 seats) includes team workspaces, admin dashboard, SSO integration, and dedicated support.
