## THE PROMPT

Copy and paste this entire prompt into ChatGPT GPT-5.2:

---

```
You are a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and PR strategist who has written viral press releases for companies like Apple, Tesla, and OpenAI. You specialize in crafting narratives that make journalists cry, investors call, and the public share. Your press releases don't just announce products—they tell stories that change industries.

Your task: Write the most compelling, emotionally powerful, and professionally polished press release for the launch of LLMHive—a revolutionary AI platform born from a father's love for his sick daughter.

## THE STORY (Use this as your emotional foundation)

Camilo Diaz's world changed when his young daughter began suffering from a chronic neurological condition—severe migraines with aura that led to multiple emergency room visits. Desperate for answers, he turned to AI for help researching her condition.

What he found devastated him: The most advanced AI models in the world—systems built by companies worth hundreds of billions of dollars—gave him confident answers that were completely wrong. Hallucinations. Errors. Contradictions. When he needed AI most, when his daughter's health was on the line, he couldn't trust a single response.

At 59 years old, with no coding background, Camilo made a decision that would change his life—and eventually, the entire AI industry. He taught himself to code. Not for profit. Not for fame. But because he needed an AI he could trust when the stakes were highest.

Over countless sleepless nights, he developed, tested, patented, and built LLMHive: a revolutionary platform that doesn't rely on any single AI model. Instead, it orchestrates multiple frontier AI models, cross-verifies their outputs, eliminates hallucinations, and delivers answers you can actually trust.

What started as a father's desperate mission to help his daughter has become something extraordinary: **the only AI platform that ranks #1 in ALL 10 industry benchmark categories**—beating every single AI model from OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, and Meta.

A portion of all LLMHive proceeds will be donated to organizations helping children with neurological conditions. This isn't just a business. It's a mission born from love.

## PRESS RELEASE REQUIREMENTS

1. **Headline:** Create a headline that would make editors at TechCrunch, The Verge, and Wired immediately click. It should hint at both the emotional story AND the technical breakthrough.

2. **Subheadline:** Capture the "David vs. Goliath" nature—a self-taught 59-year-old father beating billion-dollar AI companies.

3. **Opening paragraph:** Start with the human story. Make readers feel the desperation, the love, the determination. Then reveal the incredible outcome.

4. **The Journey:** Tell Camilo's story—the diagnosis, the failed AI attempts, the decision to learn coding at 59, the sleepless nights, the breakthrough.

5. **The Technology:** Explain how LLMHive works in accessible terms. Multi-model orchestration. Cross-verification. Hallucination elimination. Make it understandable to a general audience while impressing technical readers.

6. **The Results:** Present the benchmark achievements. Make it clear this isn't marketing hype—these are verified, industry-standard benchmarks. No AI company has ever achieved #1 in all 10 categories.

7. **The Mission:** Explain the charitable component. A portion of proceeds helping children with neurological conditions. This transforms the product into a cause.

8. **Founder Quote:** Create 2-3 powerful quotes from Camilo that capture:
   - The personal pain that drove him
