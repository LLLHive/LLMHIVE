## 6) Outreach Email Template (Media)
Subject: Miami founder’s AI platform beats GPT‑5.2 at 99.9% lower cost

Hi [Name],

I’m Camilo Diaz, founder of LLMHive. A few years ago, my teenage daughter’s neurological condition sent me to AI for answers—and I found confident, dangerous errors. I taught myself to code at 59 and built LLMHive to solve that problem.

We’re launching today. LLMHive orchestrates multiple AI models, cross‑verifies outputs, and reports #1 performance across 10 benchmark categories while cutting costs up to 99.9%. The story blends a human‑interest mission with a major technical breakthrough.

Orchestration overview: https://www.llmhive.ai/orchestration  
Case studies: https://www.llmhive.ai/case-studies

If this is a fit, I’d love to share benchmark details and a demo.

Thank you,
