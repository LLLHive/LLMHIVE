# /healthz Endpoint Fix Verification

## Overview

This document verifies that all fixes mentioned in the problem statement for the `/healthz` endpoint 404 error have been properly implemented and tested.

## Problem Statement Summary

The issue reported was a `404 Not Found` error for the `/healthz` endpoint when accessing:
```
https://llmhive-orchestrator-792354158895.us-east1.run.app/healthz
```

## Root Causes and Solutions Implemented

### ‚úÖ Cause 1: Endpoint Not Implemented

**Status**: RESOLVED - Endpoint is properly implemented

The `/healthz` endpoint is correctly defined in `llmhive/src/llmhive/app/main.py` at lines 58-67:

```python
@app.get("/healthz", summary="Health check")
async def health_check() -> dict[str, str]:
    """Health check endpoint required by Cloud Run."""
    logger.info("Health check endpoint called")
    return {"status": "ok"}
```

**Verification**: 
- Code review confirms implementation exists
- Tests pass: `tests/test_health.py::test_root_health_endpoint` ‚úì
- Local testing confirms endpoint responds with `{"status":"ok"}`

### ‚úÖ Cause 2: Code Not Deployed (Docker Cache Issue)

**Status**: RESOLVED - Build configuration includes --no-cache flag

The `cloudbuild.yaml` has been updated to include the `--no-cache` flag on line 11:

```yaml
args: ['build', '--no-cache', '-t', 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/llmhive-orchestrator:$COMMIT_SHA', '.']
```

This prevents Docker from using cached layers that might contain old code without the `/healthz` endpoint.

**Verification**:
- `grep --no-cache cloudbuild.yaml` confirms flag is present
- Build process will always use fresh code

### ‚úÖ Cause 3: Incorrect Routing or DNS Configuration

**Status**: VERIFIED - Routing is correct

The application logs all registered routes at startup. The startup logs confirm:

```
INFO - Registered routes:
INFO -   GET /
INFO -   GET /healthz
INFO -   GET /api/v1/healthz
INFO -   GET /api/v1/orchestration/providers
INFO -   POST /api/v1/orchestration/
```

The `/healthz` endpoint is properly registered at the root level (not nested under `/api/v1`), which is correct for Cloud Run health checks.

**Verification**:
- Route registration logs show `/healthz` is registered
- Local testing confirms routing works correctly
- Both `/healthz` and `/api/v1/healthz` are accessible

### ‚úÖ Cause 4: Environment Configuration Issues

**Status**: VERIFIED - Configuration is correct

The `cloudbuild.yaml` correctly configures the PORT environment variable:

```yaml
- '--port=8080'
```

The Dockerfile also sets the default PORT:

```dockerfile
ENV PORT=8080
```

And the `docker-entrypoint.sh` uses the PORT variable correctly:

```bash
PORT=${PORT:-8080}
exec uvicorn llmhive.app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port "$PORT"
```

**Verification**:
- PORT configuration exists in all necessary files
- Local testing on port 8080 works correctly

## Test Results

### Unit Tests

All health check tests pass:

```bash
$ cd llmhive && python -m pytest tests/test_health.py -v
tests/test_health.py::test_root_health_endpoint PASSED     [33%]
tests/test_health.py::test_health_endpoint PASSED          [66%]
tests/test_health.py::test_duplicate_health_endpoint_removed PASSED [100%]

3 passed in 0.07s ‚úì
```

### Local Integration Tests

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:8080/healthz
{"status":"ok"} ‚úì

$ curl http://localhost:8080/
{"service":"LLMHive Orchestrator API","status":"online","version":"1.0.0"} ‚úì

$ curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/healthz
{"status":"ok"} ‚úì
```

### Automated Verification

A comprehensive verification script has been created: `verify_healthz_fix.sh`

```bash
$ ./verify_healthz_fix.sh
==========================================
LLMHive /healthz Endpoint Verification
==========================================

‚úì /healthz endpoint found in main.py
‚úì --no-cache flag found in cloudbuild.yaml
‚úì PORT=8080 configured in cloudbuild.yaml
‚úì All health check tests passed (3/3)
‚úì Root endpoint (/) responds
‚úì /healthz endpoint responds
‚úì Response contains expected {"status":"ok"}
‚úì /api/v1/healthz endpoint responds
‚úì /healthz route is registered in startup logs

SUCCESS! All verifications passed!
```

## Deployment Instructions

To deploy the fixed code to Cloud Run:

```bash
# From the repository root
gcloud builds submit --config cloudbuild.yaml
```

This will:
1. Build a fresh Docker image with `--no-cache` (no stale layers)
2. Push the image to Container Registry
3. Deploy to Cloud Run with correct PORT configuration

### Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment, verify the endpoint is accessible:

```bash
# Test the health endpoint
curl https://llmhive-orchestrator-792354158895.us-east1.run.app/healthz

# Expected response:
# {"status":"ok"}
```

Check the Cloud Run logs to verify route registration:

```bash
gcloud logging read "resource.type=cloud_run_revision AND resource.labels.service_name=llmhive-orchestrator" --limit 50 | grep "Registered routes"
```

You should see:
```
INFO - Registered routes:
INFO -   GET /healthz
```

## Summary

All fixes mentioned in the problem statement have been:
- ‚úÖ **Implemented** in the codebase
- ‚úÖ **Verified** through unit tests
- ‚úÖ **Tested** locally with positive results
- ‚úÖ **Documented** in this verification report

The repository is ready for Cloud Run deployment. The 404 error should be resolved once the code is deployed using the `gcloud builds submit` command.
