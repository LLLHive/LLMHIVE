This typically happens with activation functions like the sigmoid or hyperbolic tangent (tanh), which squash the input into a limited range. \n\nAs a result, when the network is deep, and weights are initialized poorly, the gradients that affect the weights in the earlier layers become very small. Consequently:\n- The weights of these layers hardly get updated, leading to slow or stalled learning.\n- The neural network struggles to capture long-term dependencies in tasks such as sequence modeling.\n\nThis behavior severely limits the depth of networks that can be effectively trained and leads to poorer performance in many applications.\n\n### Requirement 2: Describe how modern architectures like ResNets and Transformers address the vanishing gradient problem.\n1. **ResNets (Residual Networks)**:\n - **Skip Connections**: ResNets utilize skip connections (or residual connections) that allow gradients to bypass certain layers during backpropagation. This means that even if the gradients become small, they can be directly propagated through these skips without diminishing.\n - **Identity Mapping**: The architecture includes identity mappings, which means that the output of layers can be added to the input directly. This helps maintain stable gradients and allows the network to learn residual mappings rather than the original unreferenced mappings.\n\n2. **Transformers**:\n - **Layer Normalization**: Transformers employ layer normalization, which normalizes the inputs to each layer. This ensures that the gradients maintain a more consistent scale during training, reducing the chance of them vanishing.\n - **Self-Attention Mechanism**: The self-attention mechanism utilized in Transformers computes representations of inputs with respect to each other. This drastically reduces the distances over which the model learns dependencies, allowing gradients to flow more effectively than in traditional recurrent architectures.\n\nBoth architectures have been pivotal in advancing the capabilities of deep learning in image recognition, natural language processing, and other complex tasks, effectively mitigating the vanishing gradient issue.\n\n## Final Checklist\n\u2610 All numbered requirements are addressed \n\u2610 Each part has complete details (not just mentioned) \n\u2610 The response is organized and easy to follow \n\u2610 Nothing from the original request is missing\n```", "judge_score1": 9.0, "judge_score2": 5.0, "judge_rationale1": "```javascript\n## Identification of Requirements\n\nRequirement 1: Explain how a neural network learns through backpropagation. \nRequirement 2: Use a simple example with a 2-layer network.\n\n## Address Each Requirement Completely\n\n### Requirement 1: Explain how a neural network learns through backpropagation.\n\nA neural network learns through backpropagation, a supervised learning algorithm used to minimize the error in the predictions of the network.
