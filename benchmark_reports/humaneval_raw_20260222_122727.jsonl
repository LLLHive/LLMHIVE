Identify All Requirements\nRequirement 1: Provide a corrected function for calculating the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) around the mean for a list of numbers.\nRequirement 2: Ensure that the function handles all edge cases, including an empty list.\nRequirement 3: Maintain proper indentation and syntax to avoid any runtime errors.\nRequirement 4: Return the correct output based on the provided test data.\n\n### 2. Address Each Requirement Completely\n\n#### Requirement 1: Corrected Function for Mean Absolute Deviation\nI will provide the corrected Python function that accurately calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) based on the following description: \nMAD = average | x - x_mean | where x_mean is the mean of the dataset.\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:\n    \"\"\"Calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation around the mean of a dataset.\"\"\"\n    if not numbers:  # Requirement 2: Check for empty list\n        raise ValueError(\"numbers must not be empty\")\n    \n    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)  # Calculate the mean of the dataset.\n    mad = sum(abs(x - mean) for x in numbers) / len(numbers)  # Calculate MAD.\n    return mad  # Return the calculated Mean Absolute Deviation.\n```\n\n#### Requirement 2: Edge Case Handling\nThe function includes a check (if not numbers) to raise a ValueError if the input list is empty. This ensures that the function adheres to good practices by avoiding operations on invalid input.\n\n#### Requirement 3: Proper Indentation and Syntax\nThe provided code is correctly indented and follows Python syntax rules. The error regarding indentation does not occur as the structure is clear, and it follows standard Python conventions for defining functions and handling conditions.\n\n#### Requirement 4: Return Correct Output Based on Test Data\nThe function can be tested using the provided input example:\n\n```python\nprint(mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]))  # Expected output: 1.0\n```\n\n### 3. Final Checklist\n\u2611\ufe0f All numbered requirements are addressed.  \n\u2611\ufe0f Each part has complete details, including an example.  \n\u2611\ufe0f The response is organized and easy to follow.  \n\u2611\ufe0f Nothing from the original request is missing.  \n\nThis function meets all specified requirements and should perform correctly when executed.\n```", "model": ["GPT-5"], "timestamp": "2026-02-22T12:28:23.707726"}
{"problem_id": "HumanEval/4", "attempt": 3, "raw_response": "```python\n## 1. Identify All Requirements\n\nRequirement 1: Provide a corrected function for calculating the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) around the mean for a list of numbers.  \nRequirement 2: Ensure that the function handles all edge cases, including an empty list.  \nRequirement 3: Maintain proper indentation and syntax to avoid any runtime errors.  \nRequirement 4: Return the correct output based on the provided test data.  \n\n## 2. Address Each Requirement Completely\n\n### Requirement 1: Corrected Function for Mean Absolute Deviation\nHere is the corrected implementation of the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) function:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:\n    if not numbers:  # Check for empty list\n        return float('nan')  # Return NaN if the list is empty\n\n    # Calculate the mean\n    x_mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)\n    \n    # Calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation\n    mad = sum(abs(x - x_mean) for x in numbers) / len(numbers)\n    \n    return mad\n```\n\n### Requirement 2: Handling Edge Cases\nThe function includes a check for an empty list. If the input list `numbers` is empty, it returns `float('nan')`, which is a standard way to represent 'Not a Number' in Python, indicating the mean absolute deviation cannot be calculated.\n\n### Requirement 3: Proper Indentation and Syntax\nThe provided code maintains proper indentation and syntax. Each variable and function is clearly defined and the structure adheres to Python coding standards. There are no syntax errors, ensuring that the code will execute without any runtime issues.\n\n### Requirement 4: Return the Correct Output Based on the Provided Test Data\nTo illustrate that this function works correctly, we can test it with the provided input `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]`. \n\n```python\n# Test data\nresult = mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])\nprint(result)  # Expected output: 1.0\n```\n\nThe expected output for this test case is `1.0`, which matches the result of the calculator verification.\n\n## 3. Final Checklist\nAll requirements are addressed:  \n\u2611 Requirement 1: Correct function provided.  \n\u2611 Requirement 2: Edge cases handled (empty list).  \n\u2611 Requirement 3: Code has correct indentation and syntax.  \n\u2611 Requirement 4: Correct output illustrated with a specific test case.\n\nThis response is organized, complete, and adheres to every part of the request.\n```", "model": ["GPT-5"], "timestamp": "2026-02-22T12:28:47.840870"}
