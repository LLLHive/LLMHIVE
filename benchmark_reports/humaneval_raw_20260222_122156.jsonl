{"problem_id": "HumanEval/0", "attempt": 2, "raw_response": "```python\n## 1. Identify All Requirements\n\n**Requirement 1:** Provide a corrected Python function for checking if any two numbers in a list are closer than a given threshold.\n\n## 2. Address Each Requirement Completely\n\n### Requirement 1: Provide a corrected Python function for checking if any two numbers in a list are closer than a given threshold.\n\nHere is the corrected implementation of the function `has_close_elements`. This version resolves the indentation error and checks if any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the specified threshold. The code utilizes a nested loop to compare each pair of numbers:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:\n    \"\"\" Check if in given list of numbers, any two numbers are closer to each other than given threshold.\n    \n    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)\n    False\n    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)\n    True\n    \"\"\"\n    for i in range(len(numbers)):\n        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):\n            if abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold:\n                return True\n    return False\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The function iterates through the list of numbers using indices `i` and `j`, where `j` starts from `i + 1` to avoid repeating pairs and comparing a number with itself.\n- The condition `abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold` checks if the absolute difference between two numbers is less than the specified threshold. If this condition is satisfied, the function returns `True`.\n- If no such pair exists, the function returns `False`.\n\n### Test Cases:\nYou can test the function with:\n1. `has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)` \u2192 Should return `False`.\n2. `has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)` \u2192 Should return `True`.\n\n## 3. Final Checklist\n- Requirement 1 has been addressed with a complete solution.\n- The response is structured and organized clearly.\n- All necessary details are included, with examples demonstrating the function's correctness.\n\nThis concludes the response to the request, addressing every part as required.\n```", "model": ["GPT-5"], "timestamp": "2026-02-22T12:22:48.249290"}

If no such pairs exist after checking all combinations, it returns `False`.\n\n### Example Usage:\n```python\nresult1 = has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)  # Output: False\nresult2 = has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)  # Output: True\n```\n\n## 3. For Technical/Design Tasks, Include:\n- The function is structured for clarity, using descriptive names and docstrings for documentation.\n- It adheres to best practices by utilizing type hints to specify the expected types of input parameters.\n- The function is efficient for small to moderate-sized lists, but consider optimization techniques for very large datasets, such as sorting the list first.\n\n## 4. Final Checklist\n- [x] All numbered requirements are addressed.\n- [x] Each part has complete details.\n- [x] The response is organized and easy to follow.\n- [x] Nothing from the original request is missing. \n\nThis concludes the complete response to the request.\n```", "model": ["GPT-5"], "timestamp": "2026-02-22T12:23:22.222807"}
