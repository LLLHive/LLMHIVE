Decimal type; however, for general-purpose float inputs, modf is appropriate.\n - Keep imports local if the function is standalone (as shown) or move imports to module scope if integrating into a larger codebase.\n\n- Addressing Requirement 5 (Final checklist confirmation)\n - Authoritative calculator result incorporated exactly as provi", "model": ["GPT-5.2"], "timestamp": "2026-02-22T13:11:07.350254"}
