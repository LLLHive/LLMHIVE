# LLMHive Complex Reasoning Benchmark Suite v1.0
# ==============================================
# This suite tests complex reasoning capabilities across multiple dimensions:
# - Multi-hop reasoning
# - Tool-backed reasoning
# - Factoid ambiguity handling
# - Code + reasoning
# - Clarification + fallback quality
#
# Scoring:
# - objective_weight: Weight for deterministic/ground-truth scoring (0-1)
# - rubric_weight: Weight for qualitative/rubric scoring (0-1)
# - critical: If true, failure on this prompt marks the entire run as FAIL
