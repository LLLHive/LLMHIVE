## Architecture

LLMHive uses a revolutionary multi-agent architecture:

1. **Query Reception**: User input is analyzed to determine required expertise
2. **Agent Dispatch**: Relevant specialist agents are activated in parallel
3. **Parallel Processing**: Each agent generates its perspective independently
4. **Consensus Building**: Agents debate and verify each other's outputs
5. **Fact Checking**: Claims are verified against trusted sources
6. **Response Synthesis**: A unified response is created from agent inputs
7. **Transparency Layer**: User can view the full collaboration process

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 16 with App Router
- **AI SDK**: Vercel AI SDK v5 with AI Gateway
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 with custom bronze/gold theme
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui with custom enhancements
- **Real-time**: Streaming responses with React hooks
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript throughout

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run development server: `npm run dev`
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## The LLMHive Difference

Unlike traditional single-model chatbots, LLMHive represents a 10-year evolution:

- **Single Model → Agent Hive**: Multiple specialists instead of one generalist
- **Black Box → Transparency**: See exactly how responses are generated
- **Static → Dynamic**: Tune AI behavior in real-time with equalizer
- **Isolated → Integrated**: Deep integration with developer tools
- **Individual → Collaborative**: Team workspaces and sharing

## Future Roadmap

- [ ] Voice conversations with multi-agent processing
- [ ] Agent library with custom agent creation
- [ ] Enterprise admin dashboard
- [ ] Mobile app with full feature parity
- [ ] Public API for programmatic access
