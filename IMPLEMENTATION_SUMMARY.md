- Streaming response generation
- Memory integration
- Content validation

**Workflow:**
1. Create blackboard with prompt
2. Generate LLM-driven plan
3. Assemble dream team of models
4. Execute plan blocks (sequential/parallel)
5. Apply iterative refinement if critic feedback exists
6. Synthesize and stream final answer
7. Validate and store in memory

**Router** (`app/orchestration/router.py`)
- Role-based model selection
- Strength-aware matching
- Dream team assembly
- Support for multiple roles

### 6. Code Quality Improvements ✓

**Robustness:**
- Improved JSON parsing with bracket counting
- Robust plan structure handling
- Graceful error handling throughout

**Security:**
- No internal errors exposed to users
- Proper logging instead of print statements
- Environment-based API key management
