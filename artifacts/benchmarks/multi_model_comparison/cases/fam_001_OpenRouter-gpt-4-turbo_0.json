Fleming was a Scottish bacteriologist who noticed that a mold called Penicillium notatum had accidentally contaminated a petri dish in his laboratory and was killing the bacteria he was studying. This observation led to the development of penicillin, the first widely used antibiotic, which has had a profound impact on the treatment of bacterial infections.",
