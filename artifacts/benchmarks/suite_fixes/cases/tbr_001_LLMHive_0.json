($1.3 million / $4.5 million) * 100 = 28.89% (correct) Check 3: Ensure logical consistency.\n\nThe profit margin is a standard calculation and the steps applied here are appropriate. === CONFIDENCE === Confidence level: 100% Most uncertain about: Nothing; the procedure and calculations used are standard. === FINAL ANSWER === 28.89%.",
