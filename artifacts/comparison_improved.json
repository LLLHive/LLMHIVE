Some flowers fade quickly\n\n**Why we can't make the conclusion:**\n\nThe relationship between roses and flowers that fade quickly is not established by these premises. Here's why:\n\n- While all roses are flowers, roses only make up a subset of all flowers\n- The \"some flowers\" that fade quickly might be entirely different types of flowers (like tulips, daisies, or lilies)\n- The premises don't tell us whether any roses are included in the group of \"flowers that fade quickly\"\n\n**Visual example:**\nImagine flowers as a large circle. Roses form a smaller circle completely inside the flower circle. The \"flowers that fade quickly\" could be another circle that:\n- Overlaps with roses (meaning some roses fade quickly)\n- Doesn't overlap with roses at all (meaning no roses fade quickly)\n- Partially overlaps with roses (meaning some but not all roses fade quickly)\n\nSince we don't know which scenario is true, we cannot logically conclude that some roses fade quickly. The premises are consistent with the possibility that NO roses fade quickly - perhaps all the quickly-fading flowers are non-rose varieties.\n\nThis is a common logical fallacy called \"undistributed middle\" - just because two groups (roses and quickly-fading flowers) are both related to a third group (flowers) doesn't mean they're related to each other.",

`404` avoids resource enumeration).\n\n### Security basics\n- Always HTTPS\n- Rate limit login and refresh endpoints\n- Store passwords as salted hashes (bcrypt/argon2)\n- Validate input strictly; return `400` with details\n\nIf you want, I can also provide an OpenAPI (Swagger) spec for this API.",

Authentication Strategy\n\n#### JWT-Based Authentication Flow\n\n1. **Registration Process:**\n   - User provides email, username, and password\n   - Password is hashed using bcrypt (with salt rounds of 10+)\n   - User record is created in database\n   - Email verification token is sent (optional)\n\n2. **Login Process:**\n   ```http\n   POST /api/auth/login\n   Content-Type: application/json\n\n   {\n     \"email\": \"user@example.com\",\n     \"password\": \"SecurePassword123!\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n   **Response:**\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"success\": true,\n     \"data\": {\n       \"accessToken\": \"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...\",\n       \"refreshToken\": \"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...\",\n       \"expiresIn\": 3600,\n       \"tokenType\": \"Bearer\",\n       \"user\": {\n         \"id\": \"123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000\",\n         \"email\": \"user@example.com\",\n         \"username\": \"johndoe\"\n       }\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Token Management:**\n   - **Access Token**: Short-lived (15-30 minutes), contains user ID and permissions\n   - **Refresh Token**: Long-lived (7-30 days), stored in httpOnly cookie\n   - Tokens are signed with RS256 or HS256 algorithm\n\n4. **Authorization Header:**\n   ```http\n   Authorization: Bearer <access_token>\n   ```\n\n5. **Token Refresh Flow:**\n   ```http\n   POST /api/auth/refresh\n   Cookie: refreshToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...\n   ```\n\n6. **Security Measures:**\n   - Rate limiting on auth endpoints (e.g., 5 attempts per 15 minutes)\n   - IP-based blocking for suspicious activities\n   - Refresh token rotation on use\n   - Logout blacklists tokens until expiration\n   - HTTPS required for all endpoints\n   - CORS properly configured\n   - Input validation and sanitization\n   - SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries\n\n#### Middleware Example (Pseudocode):\n```javascript\nfunction authenticateToken(req, res, next) {\n  const authHeader = req.headers['authorization'];\n  const token = authHeader && authHeader.split(' ')[1];\n\n  if (!token) {\n    return res.status(401).json({\n      success: false,\n      error: {\n        code: \"UNAUTHORIZED\",\n        message: \"Access token required\"\n      }\n    });\n  }\n\n  jwt.verify(token, process.env.ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET, (err, user) => {\n    if (err) {\n      return res.status(403).json({\n        success: false,\n        error: {\n          code: \"FORBIDDEN\",\n          message: \"Invalid or expired token\"\n        }\n      });\n    }\n    \n    req.user = user;\n    next();\n  });\n}\n```\n\nThis design provides a secure, scalable, and maintainable REST API for a todo list application with proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.",
