          "answer": "To calculate the profit margin percentage, you first need to determine the profit. Profit is calculated as revenue minus expenses:\n\n\\[ \\text{Profit} = \\text{Revenue} - \\text{Expenses} = \\$2,400,000 - \\$1,680,000 = \\$720,000 \\]\n\nThe profit margin percentage is then calculated by dividing the profit by the revenue and multiplying by 100 to convert it to a percentage:\n\n\\[ \\text{Profit Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Profit}}{\\text{Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{720,000}{2,400,000} \\right) \\times 100 = 30\\% \\]\n\nTo improve the profit margin to 40%, we need to determine what the expenses should be while keeping the revenue the same. A 40% profit margin means that 40% of the revenue is profit. Therefore, 60% of the revenue must be the expenses, because:\n\n\\[ \\text{Profit Margin} = 100\\% - \\text{Expenses Percentage} \\]\n\nGiven the revenue is $2.4 million, the expenses should be 60% of that to achieve a 40% profit margin:\n\n\\[ \\text{Expenses} = \\text{Revenue} \\times 0.60 = \\$2,400,000 \\times 0.60 = \\$1,440,000 \\]\n\nSo, to achieve a 40% profit margin with the same revenue, the company should reduce its expenses to $1.44 million.",

          "answer": "To solve this problem, we can use a system of equations. Let's define:\n\n- \\( c \\) as the number of chickens\n- \\( r \\) as the number of rabbits\n\nWe know two things from the problem:\n\n1. The total number of heads is 35. Each animal has one head, so:\n   \\[\n   c + r = 35\n   \\]\n\n2. The total number of legs is 94. Chickens have 2 legs and rabbits have 4 legs, so:\n   \\[\n   2c + 4r = 94\n   \\]\n\nNow we have the following system of equations:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n1. & \\quad c + r = 35 \\\\\n2. & \\quad 2c + 4r = 94\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nWe can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:\n\\[\nc + 2r = 47\n\\]\n\nNow, we have the simplified system:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n1. & \\quad c + r = 35 \\\\\n2. & \\quad c + 2r = 47\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nNext, we can eliminate \\( c \\) by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:\n\\[\n(c + 2r) - (c + r) = 47 - 35\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\nr = 12\n\\]\n\nNow that we know \\( r = 12 \\), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \\( c \\):\n\\[\nc + 12 = 35\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( c \\), we get:\n\\[\nc = 35 - 12 = 23\n\\]\n\nThus, the farmer has 23 chickens and 12 rabbits. Let's verify the solution by checking the number of legs:\n\n- Chickens contribute \\( 23 \\times 2 = 46 \\) legs.\n- Rabbits contribute \\( 12 \\times 4 = 48 \\) legs.\n- Total legs = \\( 46 + 48 = 94 \\), which matches the given number of legs.\n\nSo, the solution is verified: the farmer has 23 chickens and 12 rabbits.",
