TECH_0001,Chain-of-Thought Prompting,Single-Agent LLM,N/A,Single agent,stepwise-deductive,no,Model generates a series of intermediate reasoning steps before final answer (improves complex QA and math performance),SRC_0001
TECH_0002,Self-Consistency Decoding,Single-Agent LLM,N/A,Single agent,multi-path voting,no,Model samples multiple reasoning chains and selects the most consistent answer by majority boosting reasoning accuracy by large margins,SRC_0002
TECH_0003,Tree-of-Thought (ToT),Single-Agent LLM,N/A,Single agent,search-based reasoning,no,Model explores a branching tree of possible thought steps with backtracking and lookahead enabling deliberate planning (e.g. GPT-4 success on a puzzle rose from 4% to 74% using ToT),SRC_0004
TECH_0004,ReAct (Reason+Act),Single-Agent with Tools,interleaved reasoning & tool-use,Single agent,tool-augmented,yes,Model alternates between thought steps and actions (API calls) to gather information and update plans which reduces hallucinations and improves task success,SRC_0003
TECH_0005,Self-Refine Prompting,Single-Agent LLM,iterative self-feedback,Single agent,self-critique,no,Model generates an initial draft then critiques and revises its own output iteratively without extra training yielding ~20% quality improvements across tasks,SRC_0005
TECH_0006,Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),Single-Agent with Tools,retrieve-then-read,Single agent,knowledge-augmented,yes,Model retrieves relevant documents from an external corpus and incorporates them into the prompt before answering enabling use of up-to-date/domain-specific info and reducing hallucination,SRC_0012
TECH_0007,Multi-Agent Debate (MAD),Multi-Agent Peer,turn-based debate,Multiple peer agents,dialectical,no,Multiple agents argue and critique each others answers in a structured sequence moderated by a judge model aiming to refine reasoning and correct errors; diversity of viewpoints is key to success,SRC_0006
TECH_0008,Expert Panel (Ensemble),Multi-Agent Parallel,independent contributions,Multiple specialists,ensemble reasoning,optional,Multiple expert agents (e.g. Analyst Reasoner Verifier) address a query in parallel and their outputs are synthesized into a final answer leveraging diverse expertise for comprehensive responses,SRC_0007
TECH_0009,Challenge & Refine Loop,Multi-Agent Iterative,critique-refinement loop,Challenger + Responder,adversarial refinement,no,One agent (or sub-model) generates a draft and a secondary agent identifies flaws and suggests fixes; the first agent revises the answer. Iterate until no issues remain or max loops producing more correct answers,SRC_0007
TECH_0010,ChatDev Multi-Stage,Multi-Agent Sequential,phase-wise handoff,Roles: Designer & Programmer & Tester & Doc,workflow reasoning,no,Simulated software team: agents take on roles (design coding testing etc.) and communicate in a waterfall chat chain completing an entire software project in minutes with minimal human input (e.g. a gomoku game in 7 minutes <$1),SRC_0008
TECH_0011,MacNet DAG Orchestration,Multi-Agent Hierarchical,topological order DAG,Many specialized nodes,distributed reasoning,no,Large-scale multi-agent network organized as a directed acyclic graph with instructor and assistant roles along each edge; agents pass refined solutions through the network.

TECH_0012,HuggingGPT Orchestrator,Multi-Model Hierarchical,centralized controller,Controller + tool-experts,plan-and-execute,yes,A large LLM (controller) parses the user request into tasks selects appropriate expert models for each (via HuggingFace hub) runs subtasks (vision speech etc.) then integrates the results into a final answer – effectively using an LLM to manage a team of specialized AI models,SRC_0010

# architectures
architecture_id,pattern_name,description
ARCH_0001,Single-Agent Monolithic,A single LLM handles the query end-to-end without specialized divisions (baseline architecture for prompts)
ARCH_0002,Single-Agent + Tools,A single LLM augmented with tool use (APIs search etc.) to fetch external information or execute actions
ARCH_0003,Multi-Agent Parallel,Multiple LLM agents work independently on the problem (often with different specializations) and their outputs are later combined
ARCH_0004,Multi-Agent Sequential,Multiple LLM agents arranged in a pipeline of stages passing context and results from one role to the next (workflow chain)
ARCH_0005,Multi-Agent Hierarchical,An orchestrator (lead agent) coordinates subordinate agents (or models) in a tree or DAG structure assigning tasks and integrating results
ARCH_0006,Multi-Agent Adversarial,Agents engage in a debate or critique format either against each other or with a designated critic/judge to refine the answer through conflict and resolution
ARCH_0007,Iterative Self-Improvement,A single LLM (or team) iteratively refines its output by self-critiquing and updating the response in multiple rounds within one session
